Setup the DolphinEngine

First you need to download Visual Studio to compile the project. I recommend downloading Visual C++ Studio 2008, as all the code was written in it.

Next you will need to add the solution to your Visual Studio. Either open the .vcproj file or add it to File.

Then you will need to write the script itself in main.cpp (see script.txt).

Next you need to right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and click Build. After this, the Debug folder will appear, where the compiled application is located.

----

The include folder is responsible for libraries for the correct operation of the application or game. This folder is essentital.

The source folder is responsible for scripts for the environment to work, as well as the application or game (see _script.txt). This folder is essentital.

The _docs folder contains text files for help and assistance in the graphics engine. It can be deleted, it is optional.

The templates folder contains test projects. They are mainly needed for help, references, and for testing itself. This folder can be deleted, it is optional.

The Debug file contains the compiled project itself.

That's all!
Good luck with your development!
