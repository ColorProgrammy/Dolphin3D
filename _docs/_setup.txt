Setup the DolphinEngine

First you need to download Visual Studio to compile the project.
I recommend downloading Visual C++ Studio 2008, as all the code was written in it.

Next you will need to add the solution to your Visual Studio.

Then you will need to write the script itself in main.cpp (see script.txt).

Next you need to right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and click Build.
After this, the Debug folder will appear, where the compiled application is located.

----

The include folder is responsible for libraries for the correct operation of the application or game.
The _docs folder contains text files for help and assistance in the graphics engine.
The templates folder contains test projects. They are mainly needed for help, references, and for testing itself.
The Debug file contains the compiled project itself. (when it appears, at first it won't be there)

----

That's all!
Good luck with your development!
