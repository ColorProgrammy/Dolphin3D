# Tips

Here is a list of tips for you:

- Use examples and templates to avoid rewriting code for an empty scene. Also, use them to learn through practice.
- You can modify the framework's internals to suit your needs. This is probably advice for programming professionals. Don't remove anything unless you're absolutely sure you won't break the engine.
- It is also advisable not to set too large values for the screen size (up to about 150x30)
