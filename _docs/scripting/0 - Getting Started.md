# Getting Started

### Welcome to DolphinEngine

Here we will teach you all about scripting.
But first, it is recommended to read this.

---

##### First you need to configure DolphinEngine (see _setup.md).
##### Next, you are recommended to know the basics of C++.
##### And follow our instructions.

This project involves a lot of math,
but you don't need to understand it all. :)

There are also libraries,
but you shouldn't go into them.

#### By the end you will be able to make a small application yourself.

## Good luck!
