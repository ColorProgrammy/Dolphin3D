### Setup the Dolphin3D

First you need to download Visual Studio to compile the project.

I recommend downloading `Visual Studio C++ 2008`, as all the code was written in it.

> For `Visual Studio 2010` and above, use migration, but be aware that there may be consequences.

-----

Add files to the project.

Include the main `Dolphin3D` library in this path: `../include/Dolphin3D.h`.

Then you will need to write the script itself in `main.cpp`.

Use the manual to write it.

-----

Next you need to right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and click `Build`.

The compiled application should appear in the `bin` folder (if you added output to this folder in the project settings)

----

### Folders

The `src` folder includes scripts.

The `include` folder is responsible for libraries for the correct operation of the application or game.

The `_docs` folder contains text files for help and assistance in the graphics engine.

The `examples` folder contains test projects. They are mainly needed for help, references, and for testing itself.

The `bin` file contains the compiled project itself.

The `tools` folder contains useful utilities.

----

### That's all!
### Good luck with your development!
