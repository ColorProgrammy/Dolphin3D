### Setup the Dolphin3D CL

First you need to download Visual Studio to compile the project.

I recommend downloading `Visual Studio C++ 2008`, as all the code was written in it.

Add files to the project.

> Select only main.cpp, assets and include folders for correct work, just in case

Then you will need to write the script itself in `main.cpp`.

Next you need to right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and click `Build`.

After this, the `debug` folder will appear, where the compiled application is located.

----

The `include` folder is responsible for libraries for the correct operation of the application or game.

The `_docs` folder contains text files for help and assistance in the graphics engine.

The `templates` folder contains test projects. They are mainly needed for help, references, and for testing itself.

The `debug` file contains the compiled project itself. (when it appears, at first it won't be there)

----

### That's all!
### Good luck with your development!
