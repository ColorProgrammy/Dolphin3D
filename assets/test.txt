an ordinary file, nothing remarkable, 
a text file, was made for a copy test, 
which you can try out for yourself on our magnificent, 
uncomplicated, simple, the only engine at the moment that anyone can try, 
even a student, even a worker, even a child, even a grandfather and grandmother can do anything,
you will probably even like this engine you are on it you will be able to make unusual games, 
both commercial and non-commercial, this is actually a useful thing by the way, look at the logs,
didn't you know, but they are here, 
look in Documents -> <your folder> -> log point txt
haha thought I'd write a point well, yes, there's a lot more there,
also try experimenting with the engine, 
adding your libraries and the like,
it's not cool, yes, you can also store music, 
images and the like in assets where this file is located isn't it cool, 
and yes, you'll probably ask why I'm writing this, 
and I'll say I don't know, and don't ask why it's all in one sentence, 
I just want to fill out this boring file somehow, 
although it plays a big role,
I already wrote at the beginning what this file is for, well, 
I probably would rather be writing code instead of boring writing and filling out this file by the way,
I'm watching Terminator 2 now, it's quite interesting recommend (this is not an advertisement) 
ooooh, he'll jump into the lava right now,
I see it yes yes yes yes 
he's drowning a little more and he's drowned that's an achievement nice oh, 
I've come a long way and so I've already been tired of writing code for 3 months, 
I'm the only one writing it, I'm so tired but there's no one else to write code, 
it's sad very very very by the way, who reads how many commas here, 
I'll give Tom a cookie idk from where should I take it okay, 
I think I'll go for now, 
adios ciao cocoa bye bye by the way, 
and how will it be in Chinese i dont know okay, 
I'll go again for now, thank you all for reading this nonsense, 

period
