# Here are the templates

To `apply them` to your application, 

you need to `copy the code` from the file and `paste it` into `main.cpp`

or 

`copy the file` with the required code and `paste it` where your project is located (you may need to replace the files).

---

You can also add `your templates` here to simplify working with the `framework`.

## Good luck
