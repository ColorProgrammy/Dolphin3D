# Dolphin3D

### A graphic engine
`Version: v1.0.0a`

Dolphin3D is an open source framework for console 3D rendering. It's easy to use. There are templates to help you create renderings. The scripting itself is done in C-based languages, but we've kept it as simple as possible so you can easily write code.

Our engine is unique, easy to write code and has a wide range of functions.

This graphics engine is suitable for `beginners` :D.

Also see `_docs` for guidance and help.

And read the `license`.

--------

Good luck with the `development`.
