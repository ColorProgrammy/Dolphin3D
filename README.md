DolphinEngine is an open source framework for console 3D rendering. It's easy to use. There are templates to help you create renderings. The scripting itself is done in C++, but we've kept it as simple as possible so you can easily write code.

This graphics engine is suitable for beginners.

Develop games for fun!
Good luck with the development.
