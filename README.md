DolphinEngine is an open source framework for console 3D rendering. It's easy to use. There are templates to help you create renderings. The scripting itself is done in C-based languages, but we've kept it as simple as possible so you can easily write code.

Also see `_docs` for guidance and help.

And read the `license`.

This graphics engine is suitable for `beginners` **:D**

Develop games for **fun**!

Good luck with the `development`.
