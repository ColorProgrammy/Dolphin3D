# Dolphin3D

### A graphic engine
`Version: v1.0 (in development right now)`

#### Our engine is unique, easy to write code and has a wide range of functions.

Dolphin3D is an open source framework for console 3D rendering. It's easy to use. There are templates to help you create renderings. The scripting itself is done in C and C++ languages, but we've kept it as simple as possible so you can easily write code.

Unlike other engines, this one is really easy to use, especially if you use the guides (which are in the `_docs` folder)

This graphics engine is suitable for `beginners` :D.

See `_docs` for guidance and help.

And read the `license`.

--------

Good luck with the `development`.
